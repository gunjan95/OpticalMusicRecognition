# OpticalMusicRecogntion
Character Recognition has been an active area of research for a long time. We intend to use the general techniques in this field and apply them for recognizing symbols from musical notes images. The project can be divided into two major phases:musical notes recognition from an image and mapping the recognized notes-combination for generating an audio file for the notes in the original image. In brief, a scanned image of music notes will be the input and an audio file will be the output. Initial attempt is to use images containing notes in printed format. For the output file, we intend to use MIDI file format. It stands for Musical Instrument Digital Interface and can be played using suitable media player.
